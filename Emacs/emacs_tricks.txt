@ Starting emacs
emacs -q  - don't load .emacs; get an out-of-the-box emacs

@ Tags
M-. - find tag

@ Documentation basics
C-h a - find a function based on some keywords
C-h b - list current bindings
C-h f - describe function
C-h m - read about the current mode
C-h v - describe variable

@ Marks
C-u C-SPC - go to a previous mark (can be used multiple times)
C-x h 	  - mark whole buffer

@ Useful shortcuts
M-c   - capitalize word
C-x u - upcase region
C-x l - downcase region
M-U   - uppercase word
M-L   - lowercase word

@ Using numbered clipboards (registers)

C-X R S [#] - copy selection the choosen register
C-X R I [#] - paste the choosen register

@ Using macros

C-X ( - start recording a macro
C-X ) - finish recording the macro
C-X E - play the recorded macro

@ Registering/jumping to bookmarks

C-X R Space [#] - set numbered bookmark
C-X R J [#]     - jump to the selected bookmark

@ Snippets
time<tab>  - inserts current time
title<tab> - creates a title with stars (so it stands out) [like Emacs and Bash in this file]

F#: 
  opengl - inserts an opengl skeleton

Haskell:
  module - inserts a new file skeleton
  monad, arrow, args, parsec, qc [QuickCheck] - inserts a import statement

C++:
  alg-content - inserts a basic algorithm contest skeleton


0. General shortcuts
 UNSORTED
   ? C-c . 1
     follow and split

 NEWLINE

   C-m
      newline (cursor follows)
   C-o 
      newline (cursor stays)

 COMMENTS

   M-; 
       insert comment (or align if already commented) # hello
   C-u M-;
       delete comment
   C-x ; 
       set comment column to current column
   M-j
        start new line with a comment

  BOOKMARKS 
  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/BookMarks

   C-x r m
      set bookmark

   C-x r b
      jump to a bookmark


   C-x r l
      list all bookmarks
      next: a A v o

   M-x bookmark-delete
      delete bookmark by name   

1. Yasnippets

   M-x snippet-mode

   M-x yas/load-snippet-buffer
   C-c C-c

      When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet into the correct mode and menu. 

   M-x yas/tryout-snippet
   C-c C-t

       When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer, sets it to the appropriate major mode and inserts the snippet there, 
       so you can see what it looks like.

2. Major modes

 Clojure:
   C-x C-e
       evaluate expr at point (self made command, not really robust)

#### 
Emacs Lisp

1. Today's date

   (insert (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d"))


## Emacs - sciaga
	C-f	Move forward a character
	C-b	Move backward a character

	M-f	Move forward a word
	M-b	Move backward a word

	C-n	Move to next line
	C-p	Move to previous line

	C-a	Move to beginning of line
	C-e	Move to end of line

	M-a	Move back to beginning of sentence
	M-e	Move forward to end of sentence

If Emacs stops responding to your commands, you can stop it safely by
typing C-g.  You can use C-g to stop a command which is taking too
long to execute.

You can also use C-g to discard a numeric argument or the beginning of
a command that you do not want to finish.

>> Type C-u 100 to make a numeric arg of 100, then type C-g.
   Now type C-f.  It should move just one character,
   because you canceled the argument with C-g.

If you have typed an <ESC> by mistake, you can get rid of it
with a C-g.
